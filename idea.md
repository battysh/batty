I have this product idea. The whole idea goes like this: most of the development work moved to the terminal, and the modern terminals are still relics from the past. We have very limited steerability there. If we're using TMAX, the scrolling is bad; everything just doesn't work.
Any kind of orchestration inside of the terminal, let's say processes or threads, requires very old commands like sending something to the background and checking that process. There is no interactivity.
Then graphics. The terminal, just by default, is limited to characters and then move cursor commands, but it doesn't have to be that, right? What if we will build the terminal that is a superset of what terminals today, so here's an idea. In the verb basic setup, this is just a normal terminal:
- You say cursor.
- You start a program.
- You run it.
- You see an output.
It works as a normal terminal but just faster. The idea is that it will be as fast as possible.


But then, where these new capabilities come into play, it just can do more. The idea is that the system is pluggable and basically extendable, so anyone can write plugins and extensions. This terminal just provides an interface to those programs to do things.

One example is opening new panes and closing new panes, something like a command that you run and just split the screen horizontally or vertically, or close the pane, similar to tmux but more controllable from the operator, basically. One example would be running something like cloud card that can do that, like open the pane, split the pane, and close the pane. 

Another idea is that, for example, if we run an agent in the terminal, the agent usually starts to ask questions. What if we will have a runner for an agent that will monitor what agents say, and if the agent asks the user a question, so if there's a prompt to the user, then it will try to answer that question as best as it could, taking into account, for example, the task definition and maybe running some tests.

For example, just one example is that you start an agent with some test definition and tests which have to pass before the agent is done right. As the tests are passing, that means the task is done, and then you do things, for example, merge, like commit and merge changes to the main line if we work out of the work tree. Something like that, right? It is impossible in the current terminal because you just start a command and then this process takes the foreground, right. What if we could just start the process in the foreground, right, so the user could interact with it and everything, but there is something that controls that process and then reacts to what that agent does?

One example of that would be like a split pane where you can just see what the runner agent thinks and what is this, you know, controlled agent, doing. It isn't possible in the current terminals. You can write a script that will run, for example, like Claude Code, but then it's so hard to interact with it, right, and it's so hard to control it externally. 

Or another example: something like a trailer board. The trailer board, usually, works in the browser, right? What if we will have some rendering engine where this application, the CLI application, could render cards? We will be able to move cards, and, for example, as you move the cart from todo to in progress, it will just split the pane, open the agent, send the task to that agent, and then intelligently control what is happening in that execution. The execution will answer the agent's questions, and, for example, the task will be to drive this task to completion, with the definition of done already established. 

So basically it is a terminal, but it's not. It starts at a terminal in a very minimal way, but then plugins and extensions allow us to extend it to basically anything you like. We have something like that with VS Code. It has editors, plugins, and everything, but it's slow because it's TypeScript, and it is not very extendable, right? The application still dictates how it works, where there's an editor, where extensions, where everything, right? In VS Code, VS Code had been built for code, but what we are doing is that we're building it for agents. Modern agents are mostly like terminal applications, questions and answers, conversation, and for the documents, so the Markdown.

The Markdown document should be like number one application there, where we should be able to read Markdown, clearly formatted, nicely formatted, not like pseudo-formatted with colors and some application, some sale-like applications do, but it's more that, for example, you cat a Markdown document and then you have a rendered document. If the Markdown document has a mermaid diagram, it is rendered similarly to VS Code, but without all the real estate being taken by those controls. Something way more intuitive and super super fast, where you, as a user, are in control and you control it with different ways to do that, like with command line commands and with shortcuts. The shortcuts could be tied up to the CLI commands, and it is like reaching some CLI program that could just run different things and just do things. It is similar to i3 in the sense, because i3 is something like that but smart and intelligent. So what I like to get is first examples, so maybe something like that is already done, or some projects are going in that direction. Please do thorough, full research in Perplexity and on GitHub to find similar projects. We will take a look at those, feasibility, how feasible is this, and the language framework ideas there, with an emphasis on speed. I would like that to be a first-class application, right, so it's like just a normal application for Mac OS, Linux, Windows, and the general feasibility of this idea.
