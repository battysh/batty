# Phase 2.7: Minor Improvements

**Status:** Next
**Board:** `kanban/phase-2.7/`
**Depends on:** Phase 2.6 merged

## Goal

Ship small, high-impact quality and workflow improvements without introducing major architecture changes.

## Scope

- Triage and prioritize minor fixes/enhancements.
- Implement low-risk improvements that improve day-to-day Batty usage.
- Keep changes incremental, test-backed, and easy to review.

## Exit Criteria

- All tasks in `kanban/phase-2.7/tasks/` are `done`.
- Minor improvements are documented in commit history and/or phase summary.
- No regressions in core workflows (`batty work`, `batty resume`, `batty board`).
