Create the initial task list for Phase 2.7 focused on minor, low-risk improvements.

## Requirements

1. Capture candidate minor improvements from recent dogfooding and backlog notes.
2. Prioritize candidates by impact and implementation effort.
3. Split selected items into concrete tasks with clear acceptance criteria.
4. Keep task scope small enough to complete in short iterations.

## Verification

1. `kanban-md board --dir kanban/phase-2.7 --compact` shows at least one actionable backlog task.
2. Each created task has clear success criteria.
