Instruct the executor (via prompt composition) to produce `phase-summary.md` when the phase is complete. Summary contains: what was done, key decisions made, what was deferred, what to watch for.

Combined with per-task statements of work, this is the review packet for human gate in Phase 3A and director gate in Phase 3B.
