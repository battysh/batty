# Batty Roadmap

## Thesis

Developers need a way to run teams of AI agents that coordinate, communicate, and ship code autonomously. Batty implements this as a hierarchical agent command system on top of tmux.

## Principles

- tmux is the runtime. Not a stopgap — the permanent architecture.
- Compose, don't monolith. tmux + kanban-md + BYO agents.
- Ship fast. Validate with real projects before adding complexity.
- Markdown as backend. Files in, files out, git tracks everything.
- Hierarchy creates focus. Architect thinks, manager coordinates, engineers build.

---

## Historical: Phase-Based System (Complete)

The original Batty was a phase-based execution system (`batty work <phase>`) with supervisor/executor/director layers. Phases 1 through 4 shipped sequentially, covering: core agent runner, tmux supervisor, prompt detection, test gates, worktree isolation, runtime hardening, DAG scheduling, parallel execution, and merge queues.

This system was fully replaced by the team-based architecture in a ground-up rewrite. The phase-based code is gone; the lessons remain.

---

## Team Architecture: Foundation (Done)

Ground-up rewrite to hierarchical agent teams.

- **YAML-defined org chart** — architect, managers, engineers with configurable instances
- **CLI rewrite** — `init`, `start`, `stop`, `attach`, `status`, `send`, `inbox`, `assign`, `validate`, `config`, `merge`, `completions`
- **tmux layout builder** — automatic pane creation and zone-based grouping
- **Daemon** — background process for message routing, pane monitoring, status tracking
- **Watcher system** — per-agent status detection (idle, working, waiting) via pane output analysis
- **Message routing** — inbox-based delivery via tmux paste-buffer injection
- **Event logging** — all team events persisted to JSONL
- **Prompt templates** — role-specific system prompts bundled via `include_str!()`
- **Telegram bridge** — remote monitoring and message relay via Telegram bot
- **Dogfood** — Batty's own development runs on Batty teams

**Exit:** Team spawns, communicates, and operates on real projects. Telegram bridge enables remote oversight.

---

## Stabilization (Done)

Fixed build, hardened existing code, synced documentation.

- **Build fix** — resolved test compilation errors, clean build on main
- **Documentation sync** — CLAUDE.md, README, and planning docs updated to match team architecture
- **Test coverage** — 338 tests (310 batty + 28 docsgen), all passing. Coverage added for events, layout, standup, message modules
- **Template hardening** — prompt templates battle-tested across multi-agent sessions
- **Telegram bridge** — message splitting for 4096-char API limit, scoped `batty stop` to current project

**Exit:** Clean build, 338 tests pass, docs match reality.

---

## Autonomous Task Loop (Done)

End-to-end loop: board task → assign → engineer works → test → report → next task.

- **Board-driven dispatch** — daemon auto-assigns unclaimed tasks to idle engineers, 10s rate limit, hierarchy-scoped
- **Task completion detection** — idle-after-working triggers test gating for engineers with active tasks
- **Test gating** — `cargo test` in engineer worktree; pass → mark done + merge, fail → retry (max 2) → escalate
- **Progress reporting** — structured summaries flow engineer → manager → architect on completion and escalation
- **Failure handling** — 2 retries then escalation to manager, task blocked on board, architect notified

**Exit:** 357 tests passing. Given a populated board, the team works through tasks autonomously with test gating and progress reporting.

---

## Merge and Ship (Done)

Orchestrated code integration from multiple engineers working in parallel.

- **Worktree isolation** — each engineer works in a dedicated git worktree, refreshed before each assignment
- **Merge queue** — file-based lock serializes merges, rebase-before-merge ensures branches are current
- **Conflict resolution** — rebase conflicts detected and sent back to engineer via retry mechanism (max 2 retries, then escalate)
- **Branch cleanup** — `git reset --hard main` after successful merge leaves worktree clean and ready for next task

**Exit:** 362 tests passing. Engineers work in parallel, merges serialize safely, conflicts retry automatically, worktrees reset after each merge.

---

## Workflow Control Plane Rework (Done)

Move Batty from message-inferred coordination to explicit workflow state, visible orchestration, and deterministic recovery. Preserves current team model as supported legacy mode. PRD: [tasks/prd-batty-workflow-control-plane-rework.md](../tasks/prd-batty-workflow-control-plane-rework.md).

### Wave 1: Foundation Models & Board Extensions (T-001, T-002, T-003, T-007, T-016)

Establish the conceptual and data foundations before building runtime behavior.

- **Capability model** — define planner/dispatcher/executor/reviewer/orchestrator/operator responsibilities and how they resolve from role type + hierarchy across all topologies (`T-001`)
- **Workflow state model** — define task lifecycle states, ownership types, dependency semantics, and runnable/blocked criteria (`T-002`)
- **Board metadata extensions** — add workflow fields (`depends_on`, `review_owner`, `blocked_on`, `branch`, `commit`, `artifacts`, `next_action`) to task frontmatter without breaking kanban-md (`T-003`)
- **Rollout mode definitions** — define legacy/hybrid/workflow-first modes and backward-compatible adoption path (`T-007`)
- **Migration and backward compatibility** — older task files handled with safe defaults, existing configs run unchanged (`T-016`)

**Exit:** Written capability model, state model, extended board format, rollout modes, and migration behavior. All existing tests still pass.

### Wave 2: Runtime Engine (T-004, T-005, T-006, T-008, T-009, T-010, T-012)

Build the workflow engine and expose it through CLI/API.

- **Orchestrator runtime surface** — visible tmux pane for workflow decisions and activity (`T-004`)
- **CLI/API control surface** — explicit commands for task create, update state, assign, record review, trigger merge/archive/rework (`T-005`)
- **Orchestrated and non-orchestrated modes** — workflow works with or without built-in orchestrator (`T-006`)
- **Runnable-work resolver** — compute runnable/blocked/review tasks from board state without pane text (`T-008`)
- **Structured completion packets** — standardized engineer output with branch/commit/test/artifact evidence (`T-009`)
- **Review and merge state machine** — explicit review disposition driving task transitions (`T-010`)
- **Merge/artifact lifecycle tracking** — branch/artifact lifetime from execution through merge (`T-012`)

**Exit:** Orchestrator pane running, workflow mutations via CLI, review/merge state machine operational, completion packets parsed. Unit tests cover all new paths.

### Wave 3: Intelligence & Polish (T-011, T-013, T-014, T-015, T-017)

Wire up smart interventions, observability, and align prompts.

- **Dependency-aware nudges** — state-based interventions targeting the correct role (`T-011`)
- **Workflow observability metrics** — runnable count, blocked count, review age, idle-with-runnable signals (`T-013`)
- **Config-driven workflow policies** — WIP limits, escalation thresholds, intervention toggles, capability overrides (`T-014`)
- **Role prompt rewrite** — align prompts with capability model and control plane contracts (`T-015`)
- **Topology validation** — validate across solo, pair, manager-led, multi-manager, renamed-role topologies (`T-017`)

**Exit:** Batty drives execution, review, merge, recovery, and escalation from structured workflow state. Orchestrator visible in tmux. All mutations available through stable CLI/API. Prompts aligned. Metrics observable.

**Result:** 17 tasks shipped, 12 new modules, 593 tests (231 new). Validated across solo, pair, manager-led, multi-manager, and renamed-role topologies.

---

---

## Intelligence Layer (Done)

Make the team self-aware and self-improving. Build on the event stream, workflow metrics, and standup infrastructure to close the feedback loop.

### Wave 1: Periodic Standups (T-101, T-102, T-103)

Turn the existing standup module from a one-shot report into a daemon-driven periodic system with board-aware content.

- **Configurable standup interval** — `standup_interval_secs` in team.yaml; daemon triggers standup generation on the configured cadence (default: 300s). Zero disables. (`T-101`)
- **Board-aware standup content** — standups include assigned task IDs, blocked items, review queue age, and idle-with-runnable warnings alongside agent status (`T-102`)
- **Standup delivery to user** — standups for the user role are delivered via Telegram (if configured) or written to `.batty/standups/` as timestamped markdown files (`T-103`)

**Exit:** Standups fire automatically at the configured interval. Each standup shows agent status plus board context. User receives standups via Telegram or file.

### Wave 2: Run Retrospectives (T-104, T-105, T-106)

Automated post-run analysis from the event log and board state.

- **Event log analyzer** — parse events.jsonl to compute per-task cycle time, failure/retry counts, escalation frequency, merge conflict rate, idle-time percentage (`T-104`)
- **Retrospective generator** — produce a structured markdown retrospective identifying top bottlenecks, longest-running tasks, most-failed tasks, and review queue stalls. Written to `.batty/retrospectives/` (`T-105`)
- **Retrospective trigger** — `batty retro` CLI command generates a retrospective on demand. Daemon auto-generates one when all board tasks reach done/archived (`T-106`)

**Exit:** `batty retro` produces useful post-run analysis. Auto-retro fires when a run completes. Retrospectives are human-readable markdown.

### Wave 3: Failure Pattern Detection (T-107, T-108)

Surface recurring problems before they compound.

- **Failure signature tracker** — daemon maintains a rolling window of failure events (test failures, escalations, merge conflicts) and detects repeated patterns (same engineer, same file, same error class) (`T-107`)
- **Pattern notification** — when a pattern exceeds a configurable threshold, surface a structured observation to the manager or architect via the existing message bus. Not automated remediation — automated noticing (`T-108`)

**Exit:** Repeated failures are detected and surfaced as messages. Configurable thresholds prevent noise.

### Wave 4: Team Templates (T-109, T-110)

Reusable team configurations for cross-project learning.

- **Template export** — `batty export-template <name>` saves the current team.yaml, prompt files, and workflow policies as a named template to `~/.batty/templates/` (`T-109`)
- **Template init** — `batty init --from <name>` bootstraps a project from a saved template instead of defaults (`T-110`)

**Exit:** Users can save and reuse successful team configurations across projects.

**Result:** 10 tasks shipped across 4 waves, 594 tests (up from 556). Periodic standups, run retrospectives, failure pattern detection, and team templates all operational.

---

## Operational Hardening (Done)

Targeted reliability fixes based on dogfooding observations. Daemon tracing, resume logging, diagnostics, prompt refresh, test deflaking, pipeline starvation detection.

**Result:** 8 tasks shipped across 2 waves. `batty doctor` diagnostics, daemon log rotation, structured resume logging, refreshed prompt templates, deflaked timing-sensitive tests, pipeline starvation detection. Build green: 668 tests passing.

---

## Hardened Runtime (Current)

Make the system reliably complete multi-hour runs without human intervention. Addresses the failure modes observed during dogfooding: silent shell-out failures, unreliable message delivery, stale worktrees, and agent context exhaustion.

**Architectural concern:** `daemon.rs` has grown to 9249 lines. Wave 1's command infrastructure extraction is the natural opportunity to decompose it — the typed git and board layers should live in dedicated modules, pulling substantial code out of daemon.rs.

### Wave 1: Command Infrastructure (T-301, T-302, T-303)

Wrap the raw shell-outs to git and kanban-md in a structured command layer with typed errors and retry.

- **Typed git command layer** — replace scattered `Command::new("git")` calls with a structured interface that captures stderr, classifies errors (transient vs permanent), and returns typed results. Cover the ~8 git call patterns used across daemon, task loop, merge, and worktree modules. (`T-301`)
- **Typed board command layer** — same treatment for kanban-md shell-outs: structured invocation, typed errors, stderr capture. Board reads, writes, and queries all flow through this layer. (`T-302`)
- **Transient failure retry** — add configurable retry with backoff for transient errors (lock contention, network blips on git fetch). No retry on permanent errors (bad ref, permission denied). (`T-303`)

**Exit:** All shell-outs to git and kanban-md flow through typed command layers. Transient failures retry automatically. Permanent failures surface structured error messages.

### Wave 2: Delivery Reliability (T-304, T-305, T-306)

Ensure messages actually reach agents and the board reflects reality.

- **Message delivery confirmation** — after paste-buffer injection, sample the target pane output to verify the message appeared. Flag delivery failures to the daemon for retry. (`T-304`)
- **Triage counter fix** — delivered messages that can no longer be acked cause phantom triage alerts. Fix the stale-message accounting so triage count reflects only actionable items. (`T-305`)
- **Pre-assignment worktree health check** — before assigning a task, validate the target worktree is clean, on the correct base branch, and not mid-operation. Refuse assignment with a diagnostic message if unhealthy. (`T-306`)

**Exit:** Message delivery has confirmation. Triage counter is accurate. Worktree problems are caught before assignment, not after.

### Wave 3: Agent Lifecycle (T-307, T-308, T-309)

Handle agent failures gracefully instead of leaving tasks stuck.

- **Context exhaustion detection** — detect when an agent stops producing output or produces degraded output (repeated errors, empty responses) while marked as working. Surface this as a distinct agent state. (`T-307`)
- **Agent restart with context re-injection** — when an agent is detected as exhausted or crashed, restart it with the original task prompt plus a summary of work completed so far (branch state, last commit, test results). (`T-308`)
- **Stuck task detection** — if a task has been in-progress for longer than a configurable threshold with no commits or status changes, flag it to the manager as potentially stuck. (`T-309`)

**Exit:** Context exhaustion is detected and surfaced. Stuck tasks are flagged automatically. Agent restart preserves enough context to continue work.

### Wave 4: Board Integrity (T-310, T-311, T-312)

Keep board state consistent with the actual state of the world.

- **Board-git consistency check** — `batty doctor` extension that cross-references board task state with actual branch/worktree state. Detects: tasks marked in-progress with no active agent, done tasks with unmerged branches, claimed tasks with no worktree. (`T-310`)
- **Orphan cleanup** — detect and report branches/worktrees that don't correspond to any active board task. Provide a `batty doctor --fix` option for safe cleanup with confirmation. (`T-311`)
- **Auto-unblock stale tasks** — tasks blocked on dependencies that are already done (but whose board state wasn't updated) get automatically unblocked by the daemon. (`T-312`)

**Exit:** Board state is validated against git/worktree reality. Orphaned resources are detected. Stale blocked-on references are resolved automatically.

## Risks

1. **Agent reliability** — coding agents produce inconsistent output. Mitigated by test gating and manager review.
2. **Message delivery** — tmux paste injection can fail if pane is in wrong state. Mitigated by daemon retry and status checking.
3. **Context limits** — long-running agents hit context windows. Mitigated by focused task scoping and fresh agent sessions per task.
4. **Coordination overhead** — multi-agent communication adds latency. Mitigated by keeping the hierarchy shallow and messages concise.
