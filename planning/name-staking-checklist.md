- **batty.dev** — taken, parked behind Cloudflare.
- **batty.io** — taken since 2020, no live site. Could try to acquire.
- **getbatty.com** — taken, active cake business.
- Bare `batty` on GitHub is taken (inactive user "Justin", 0 repos, last active 2015).
- GitHub org **battysh** is available — preferred choice, mirrors `batty.sh` domain.
- Also available: `batty-sh`, `battyai`, `batty-ai`, `battyterm`, `batty-term`, `getbatty`, `usebatty`, `batty-dev`.
- `battydev` is taken.
- Bare `batty` on crates.io is active (battery tool) — not disputable, use `batty-cli`.
- Bluesky lets you use your domain as your handle — `@batty.sh` is excellent branding.
